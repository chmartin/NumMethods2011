Prob 3 NumMthds Sp2012
By: Chris Martin

For this run epsilon = 1e-100
This is used to set cutoffs on number of evaluations.

No. 1 (constant step h)

Integral cut at sqrt(n*pi)/10 for singularities.
If a piece between two cuts is big enough add it to integral.
The number of pieces used in the integration was: 114
Above a value of x=1.8924628453420163 The pieces of the integral were too small.
The integral was evaluated over a range: t=0-1.8924628453420163
The value of the integral is: 2.3193903407789072

No. 2 (Gaussian)

Integral cut at sqrt(n*pi)/10 for singularities.
If a piece between two cuts is big enough add it to integral.
The number of pieces used in the integration was: 115
Above a value of x=1.9007449980205131 The pieces of the integral were too small.
The integral was evaluated over a range: t=0-1.9007449980205131
The value of the integral is: 1.9643853533538913
